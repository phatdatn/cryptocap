# cryptocap
BitBroker coding challenge. React Native mobile application that fetches and displays data from CoinMarketCap.

To run this project:

  1) 'git clone https://github.com/phatdatn/cryptocap.git'
  2) 'cd cryptocap'
  3) 'npm install'
  4) Open up Android Studio or Xcode. I personally used Android Studio, so I recommend it as to avoid potential problems.
  5) Start a virtual Android or IOS device.
  6) 'react-native run-android' OR 'react-native run-ios' depending on device.
